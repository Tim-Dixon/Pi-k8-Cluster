# Axiom-Development K8's Raspberry Pi Cluster

    Project: K8's Pi Cluster
    Status: Research Phase
    Version: Alpha
    Start-Date: March 18th,2019
    Last-Updated: March 19th, 2019
#

# Purpose:
### The purpose of this project is both to learn more about Kubernetes, Docker, and other related technologies. As well, the more servers and services I run, the more I have found it be tedious to keep track of what Raspberry Pi is doing what. This model of computing also provides security and redundancy to whatever might be deployed on the cluster.

# Goals:
### What I hope to acomplish in this project.
    1. Create a working K8's Cluster
    2. Successfully impliment Docker
    3. Successfully impliment Traefik
    4. Successfully deploy Services:
        - PiHole
        - Home Assistant
        - Apache2 or Nginx
        - DDClient (Or another DNS Updater)
